# Single-Hidden-Layer-Perceptions-SHLPs

Implemented and trained a neural network from scratch in Python. Computed the gradient of the network and employed it within a gradient descent framework for parameter optimization. Initially applied to classic test cases like XOR and 3XOR, then explored the application of neural networks for the recognition of symmetric positive definite Toeplitz matrices.
